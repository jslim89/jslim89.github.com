Welcome to my technical informative blog.

## Acknowledgement
Previously I was blogging with [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/).
After that I found github page which allow me to write a static blog using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which is using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Thanks [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), now I can write a blog post with any editor that I like.

## About me
I've been started to touch opensource since **Apr 2011**.

I start to explore [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and setup [LAMP stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle\)) for my [PHP](http://www.php.net/) development during my internship training.

Everything is new to me on that time. I even sacrifice to change [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).

Is tough, my development life really tough. I've to learn command line, no `CTRL + C` & `CTRL + V` that cause me have to use `y` for copy and `p` for paste. I was wonder why Vim so hard to use, but still a lot of people are using it. Few months later, I found the answer myself~ Editing code is damn fast and convenient as there are a lot of shortcut key and those plugin. I even treat it as **Command Line IDE**.

## My development environment
* **Operating System** - [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
* **Editor** - [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* **Development Browser** - [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)
