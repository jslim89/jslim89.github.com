I believe most of you have faced such a problem. Left-click & touchpad is not working.

I googled for an hour, found some possible solution in [Apple Support Communities](https://discussions.apple.com). But none of them work.

After few reboots for my Macbook, it still not working. Finally it works after I restarted _(turn off and turn on the switch)_ my bluetooth mouse.

LOL...
