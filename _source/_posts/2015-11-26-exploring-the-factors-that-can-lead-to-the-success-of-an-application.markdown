The giant mobile marketplace already has a plethora of applications, and many more will release while I'm writing this article. Therefore, for the folks who want to make their application stand out in the pool of applications, a distinct app idea and a right approach are a must. 

No matter what is the genre of application that you are interested in developing,  there are certain common factors that can lead to the success or failure of an application. Thus, by keeping the winning factors in mind, you can increase the likelihood of your app success in the market.

Fortunately, there are many examples in the industry, who have committed mistakes while developing an application, from which you can learn and shun away the common mistakes. Here are some best practices that one must employ to ensure an intriguing and worthwhile application.

### 1. Designing is the Foundation – Don't overlook it!

For any type of application, design plays a pivotal role in its success. A poorly designed application won't attract users. And, this is surely something that you won't want to happen. For a well designed application, one must consider the four main steps. Let's have a look into these steps.

**a.) Big Idea** – The core idea behind the development of an application must be predefined, and addressed appropriately while designing the app. This idea must be something big and really useful. One may conduct several brainstorming sessions to come up with a valuable app idea.

**b.) Plan** – Once the app idea is clear, it is essential to strategically think of a plan that can help you execute the app development process. Here you will decide whether you need to focus on various functions, or on a key feature.

**c.) Layout** – Now, design the user interface by packaging the tangible products altogether to form a legible and impressive layout. Make sure that your design is simple and effective enough to entice users and encourage them to further interact with the application.

**d.) Functionality** – Till this point, it can be assumed that half of the development task is done. Now, you must ensure that the integrated features are performing flawlessly to deliver a great user experience.

### 2. Integrate Features that are in vogue..

Users, especially mobile device users tend to have a short attention span, and thus, they easily get distracted. For this reason it is advisable to integrate a few key features in your application, while ensuring that they work brilliantly. However, you can eventually upgrade the features with an increasing user base and requirements. Moreover, it is imperative to take care that whatever features you want to include in your app, they must deliver an absolute UX.

### 3. Make the content relevant and contextual
While planning the content of an application, it is vital to ensure that all the information provided in your application is relevant and making sense to the users' search. Concentrate on the key functionality of your application that is going to attract your potential users, and then think of additional features that are somehow contextual to the key feature. This can help you make your app go viral.

### 4. Call to Action should be instant and clear...
If the app UI is making it confusing for users to decide where to click next, they might end up abandoning the application. Thus, the actions that you want your users to perform must be showcased in an attractive fashion. Your target users must be able to clearly see the CTA (Call to Action) buttons on a page. This will not only enhance the UX, but will also help you achieve your ultimate goal.

### 5. Offer notification, only if required!
The significance of notifications can't be gainsaid. While notifications can augment the UX, they can also ruin the experience if they are included in apps that don't demand such feature. Thus, it can be said that notifications are not advisable for every application. However, whenever they make sense, they must be added.

### 6. Reap the benefits of Analytics..
The foremost benefit of integrating analytics in an application is that it lets one recognize the features, which are being neglected and which are being used by users. Having such insights can definitely help you iterate your app features to make it more useful. With robust analytics, you can identify the trends and instantly make suitable changes to further enhance the UX and elevate the application download rate.

### 7. Offer timely and localized information
To make your application stand ahead the curve, you must offer the best features to your users. If you can deliver localized information in a timely way, it can amazingly boost the credibility of your application. For instance, let's consider a news application. Apart from sharing regular headlines and news across the globe, if it can share news and happenings of the local area where you are at that moment, it will make the application more impressive and interesting. Thus, think out of the box and allow your application to take the benefits of location-based information by implementing the latest technologies like Beacon, Wi-Fi, GPS, etc., whichever is suitable for you.

## Conclusion

Today, when truckloads of applications are already competing for their success in the wobbly mobile marketplace, it is not an easy pie to develop a successful application. However, by keeping a few essential factors in mind, one can surely heighten the app success rate. I hope the aforementioned factors will help you focus your application in the right direction.
