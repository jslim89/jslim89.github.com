I wrote a script to sync Google Analytics _(GA)_ pageviews to own DB in daily basis.
E.g.

- 2019-12-01 -> `342` pageviews
- 2019-12-02 -> `621` pageviews
- 2019-12-03 -> `781` pageviews
- 2019-12-04 -> `388` pageviews
- 2019-12-05 -> `562` pageviews
- ...
- 2019-12-31 -> `597` pageviews

So that I can generate report _(in my web app, not GA)_ and filter by date range.

But then, I encounter an issue, when I filter the report range from `2019-06-01` to `2019-06-30`,
the total pageviews are different from GA report.

Then I cross check it day by day, and both _(GA & web app)_ are tally.

ðŸ‘† from `2019-06-01` to `2019-06-21`, both are tally

ðŸ‘† from `2019-06-01` to `2019-06-22`, the result are different.
From here, I assume the result for `2019-06-22` has problem

But when I cross check for `2019-06-22`, both are tally again ðŸ¤”

ðŸ‘† from `2019-06-19` to `2019-06-22`, the result are tally also.

Then after googled for a while, I think is caused by the GA sampling, perhaps from range 
`2019-06-01` to `2019-06-22`, the data set are too large, thus Google just pick a sample set of data. See the references ðŸ‘‡
