Welcome to my technical blog.

## About me

I learn my first programming language _(C language)_ in year 2008 in my first semester. Followed by Java, C#, Prolog.

In 2011, I started my internship training. Linux, Apache, PHP, MySQL (**LAMP stack**) are all new
to me, but I'm so excited to learn all these. I'm so lucky to meet my Linux guru _(my supervisor
[Kian-Meng, Ang](https://github.com/kianmeng))_, he had inspire me about open source stuffs, shared me lots of
Linux stuffs, Vim editor _(is my favourite editor now)_, server stuffs, GitHub, etc.

I started iOS app development in year 2012 Dec. I learn the tutorial
from [this book](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-apprentice). In this period, I switch between PHP _(REST API)_ & iOS development.

In 2015, I worked as a backend developer. Use some DevOps tools like Vagrant. Also, write some mini shell script to automate some small tasks.
One of the project involved hardware. Thus, I write a C# wrapper to wrap up the web app _(written in PHP Laravel 5)_, in order for the web app to be able to interact with hardware.
Besides, Node.js also added to this project, due to broadcast notification feature is needed.

I started an Angular _(version 5)_ project in late 2016, the stack of this project is Angular, MongoDB, MySQL, PHP _(middle-end)_, Python _(backend analysis)_. It's a digital marketing tools, using Facebook & Instagram API. I'm involving in front & middle-end here, thus is a new challenge to me.

To-be update...
