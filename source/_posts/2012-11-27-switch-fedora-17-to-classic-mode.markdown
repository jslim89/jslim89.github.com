Although the OS that I like the most is [Ubuntu 11.04](http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/natty/). Unfortunately, a lot of new packages or drivers were not supported. Thus, I give myself to try on other distro --- [Fedora 17](http://fedoraproject.org/)

It come with [Gnome 3](http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/), which is sxxx!!!

* Global `Alt + Tab`
* No horizontal workspaces (only verticle)

Today, I found an article about switching it back to classic mode _(They call it **Fallback mode**)_

First, search for keyword `system info`
![Searching](http://jslim89.github.com/images/posts/2012-11-27-switch-fedora-17-to-classic-mode/system_info.png)

Then, select **Graphics** and turned **Forced Fallback Mode** to `ON`

After that, Logout and Login back. You should see the changes.
