Welcome to my technical informative blog.

## Acknowledgement
Previously I was blogging with [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/).
After that I found github page which allow me to write a static blog using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) v2 which is using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Thanks [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), now I can write a blog post with any editor that I like.

**Update 31 October 2015:** I switch to plain Jekyll, due to there is a big change for October v2 & v3.

## About me
In year 2004, my mother bought me my very first computer, which is a custom made desktop with Windows XP installed.
At that moment, what I use the computer is just about playing games.

After some time, I was thinking to become a computer technician _(repairing computer)_ in future.
My family member & I thought that this line has a bright future, since computer has become so
common that time. I met a person who is a computer teacher _(more precise, he is computer technician)_
who can teach Microsoft Office and repair computer. But the prerequisite skill is typing without looking
on keyboard. Damn! My typing was so slow at that time, but I decided to practice it. It tooks me about
2 to 3 months time to get familiar with it. At the end I never learn _(how to repair computer)_ from him.

After high school, I'm getting to college soon. I decided to pick a computer related course _(I totally have
no idea what is programming, I thought is about repair computers)_ which is Computer Science.

I learn my first programming language _(C language)_ in year 2008 in my first semester. As usual, the
first program is to print **Hello World!**. I follow exactly what lecturer type int the editor _(Visual
C++)_, then run it, it shows me 2 words **Hello World!** in a black screen. I was... "What the hell?
What is the purpose here?" totally have no idea what is this about. But after I did my assignment _(with help
from my friend)_, I'm able to score A in that semester as well as understand the basic logic.

Until year 2011, I started my internship training. Linux, Apache, PHP, MySQL (**LAMP stack**) are all new
to me, but I'm so excited to learn all these. I'm so lucky to meet my Linux guru _(my supervisor
[Kian-Meng, Ang](https://github.com/kianmeng))_, he had inspire me about open source stuffs, teach me
Linux stuffs, Vim editor _(is my favourite editor now)_, server stuffs, GitHub, etc. The 6 months
internship really awesome.

I started mobile development _(in fact should be iOS app development)_ in year 2012 Dec. I learn the tutorial
from [this book](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-apprentice). In this period, I switch between PHP &
iOS development. I get to understand more about HTTP when designing the API.

Until October 2015, I only focus on PHP, at the same time I improve my backend skills. Like I start to use
Vagrant for the development.
