It has been 3 years since I started this blog. Recently I've received quite a number of guest post requests. Thus I created this page.

But then, most _(or I can say **all**)_ articles are non-technical stuffs. I'm welcome you post on my blog, here I have a few requirements:

## Requirements

1. Prepare the article in [markdown form](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
2. Don't send me Microsoft Word file
3. Attach the images _(if you have)_ in the email
4. I would be happy if you say _"Hi JS,"_ in the first line. Because I can see almost all guest post requests are _"Hi there"_, I hope that you're not simply blast out the same email to all bloggers
5. I would like to request USD10 for each guest post which is non-technical stuffs _(I would send you my PayPal email when you send the guest post request for me)_

Thanks all.
