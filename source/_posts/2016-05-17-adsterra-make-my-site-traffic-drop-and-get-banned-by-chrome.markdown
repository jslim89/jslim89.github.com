Today I would like to share with you, I had put Adsterra on this site. As they claimed that high CPM rate.

Right now, I notice that my site has blocked by Google Chrome.

I guess is because of, when first load the page, the first click will redirect to somewhere, this is really annoying also.

I found out there is a link about _**terraclick**_, and is from the javascript file that from Adsterra. So I remove it quickly.

Now, I check back my Google Analytics

The session drop until **50+**. If you still can see this post, I hope that you don't simply trust all these claim about _high CPM_ bla bla bla.

Use Google AdSense, otherwise use [RevenueHits](http://jsl.im/1oDPjDx). At lease I know that RevenueHits can make me some revenue, better than those scam Ads platform _(really make my site shit)_.

My revenue drop also. Please review carefully before you apply any ads on your site.
